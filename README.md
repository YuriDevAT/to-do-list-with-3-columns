# To-do-list

This project will contain three cards or boxes, where the `planned tasks`, `in-progress tasks`, and the `done tasks` will be displayed. Another useful feature will be a simple popup or modal to add a new task, and the button to delete the tasks if they are not necessary. For the design, a mockup will be created using `Figma`.
